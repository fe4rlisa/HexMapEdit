<h1>HexMapEdit</h1>

A simple tool made in pygame to edit simple hexagonal grids. Feel free to use this tool for a game or anything else. Currently this is a work in progress and I am hoping to add a few mode features and some polish to the tool.

<h1>Create simple map layouts</h1>

Click on a tile to change its color/value. Click a tile multiple times to cycle througb colors/values

<h1>Edit and save for later</h1>

Save your hexagon grid layout to a json file to use in your game or to edit later in HexMapEdit

Use "S" to save to a json file

Use "F" to load a json file


<h1>How to use</h1>

Download the HexMapEdit.py file and run it with python in your terminal!


OR 


download the .exe file in the dist folder



Saved json files start with a settings object that is used to set values when importing, and a tiles object that stores the x and y cords and the value of the tile.
