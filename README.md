#HexMapEdit

A simple tool made in pygame to edit simple hexagonal grids. Feel free to use this tool for a game or anything else. Currently this is a work in progress and I am hoping to add a few mode features and some polish to the tool.



#Create simple map layouts

Click on a tile to change its color/value. Click a tile multiple times to cycle througb colors/values

#Edit and save for later

Save your hexagon grid layout to a json file to use in your game or to edit later in HexMapEdit

Use "S" to save to a json file
Use "F" to load a json file


#How to use

Download the HexMapEdit.py file and run it with python in your terminal!

The json file starts with a settings object that is used to set values when importing, and a tiles object that stores the x and y cords and the value of the tile.
